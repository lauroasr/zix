# Bug
  - When he swap objects, he's actually using the swapped
  references as well. If I, to eliminate swap, just attribute B
  to A, and then instead of creating another object to B, just use
  the same instance as before (to avoid instantiating another object),
  both A and B would hold the same object. 
  
# To implement
  - Time events. Once created, it is going to execute the callback
  function once every timeout.
  
  - Events (by input or not). So anything can be manipulated with
  events thrown.
  
  - A simple sprite that the world is going to control. A sprite can be
  a simple object or an advanced body that has all the properties specified
  in the bodies package, and can has physics to act on it.
  
  - Renderes. I will need to focus a lot of time here. Maybe implement
  WebGL as well, but I need to study that...
